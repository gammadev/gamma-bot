# Gamma Bot

Gamma Bot is a Kotlin bot that involve a lot of features to improve development skills under different scenarios.

>Currently it is focused on Music feature, but for future implementations it would have some games and day-to-day facilitators

## Setup


## Code style

The code style is based on [Kotlin style guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/code-style-migration-guide.html) and [Google's java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), with some changes.

One of them is the modifiers and members order, that were adapted to Kotlin.

For the modifiers:
```kotlin 
override public protected private internal const lateinit inline noinline infix abstract open final inner
```

For the members: 
```Kotlin 
object val var fun interface enum companion
```
